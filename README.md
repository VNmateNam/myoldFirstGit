Install instructions
Unzip the package.
Upload the CodeIgniter folders and files to your server. Normally the index.php file will be at your root.
Open the application/config/config.php file with a text editor and set your base URL. If you intend to use encryption or sessions, set your encryption key.
If you intend to use a database, open the application/config/database.php file with a text editor and set your database settings.
Run instructions
You can run that from your terminal or your web browser.

The first step of the installer is to accept the license agreement. Scroll down through the agreement (reading it all, of course) and click the “Got it” button to accept.
The second step is to enter your database connection information.
The third step of the installer is to create an admin account. Don’t be one of those people and be sure to pick a strong password.
The final step is to define your System Name, Base URL, and Language.
